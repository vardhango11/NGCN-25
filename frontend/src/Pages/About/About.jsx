        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          At Next Gen Computing and Networking (NGCN), we are driven by a simple
          yet powerful vision — to push the boundaries of technology and create
          solutions that matter. Our journey began with a passion for exploring
          the frontiers of computing and networking, blending rigorous research
          with practical innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Led by Dr. K. E. Srinivasa Desikan, NGCN
          thrives on the harmony of knowledge, creativity, and collaboration. We
          work at the intersection of theory and application, advancing ideas
          that not only deepen scientific understanding but also address
          real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          At NGCN, we believe innovation is best achieved together. By fostering
          a collaborative environment where curiosity meets excellence, we aim
          to redefine what’s possible in computing and networking — shaping
          technologies that empower communities, industries, and humanity at
          large.
